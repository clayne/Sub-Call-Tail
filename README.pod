=head1 NAME

Sub::Call::Tail - Tail calls for subroutines and methods

=head1 VERSION

version 0.08

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Sub::Call::Tail;

    # instead of @_ = ( $object, @args ); goto $object->can("method")
    tail $object->method(@args);

    # instead of @_ = @blah; goto &foo
    tail foo(@blah);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a C<tail> modifier for subroutine and method calls that
will cause the invocation to have the same semantics as C<goto &sub>.

When the C<tail> modifier is compiled the inner subroutine call is transformed
at compile time into a goto.

=head1 USAGE WARNING

B<WARNING>! The author does not endorse using this module for anything real.
It was written primarily to demonstrate that such quackery can be achieved.
Use at your own risk!
